AirWise is a web application that helps users find nearby locations with better air quality (AQI) for short trips or vacations. Built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB, the platform offers real-time AQI data and travel recommendations based on air quality.

## Features ‚ú®

Real-Time AQI Data: Fetches live AQI data using the WAQI API.
Curated Low-AQI Destinations: Database of pre-vetted locations with consistently good air quality.
Geospatial Search: Finds nearby low-AQI locations within a specified radius.
Historical AQI Trends: Displays past AQI data for informed decision-making.
Health Recommendations: Provides health tips based on AQI levels.
Travel Assistance: Includes transport options, accommodation suggestions, and points of interest.
